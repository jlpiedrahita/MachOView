# MachOView

MatchOView is a tool for inspecting and editing files in the Mach-O file format. Executables, object files and libraries (static and dynamic) in OS X and iOS systems are all stored using this format. This tool is ideal for low level diagnosing and reverse engineering tasks.

This revamped version includes a new sleek design and modern OS X features like Full-Screen Mode.
